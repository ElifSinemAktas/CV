    <h1> Elif Sinem AKTAS </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I graduated from Gazi University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Architecture in January
2015 as an honor student with an average of 3.29 / 4.00. During my education period, I participated in national
and international workshops to increase my professional competence and to experience teamwork. In addition,
for personal reasons, I worked part-time between 2012 and 2014 in different jobs related to my profession.</p>
    <p>I worked in a corporate and international company from Sep 2014 to Jan 2021. I worked as a trainee for 5
months. Upon graduation I received the title of Project Architect. For 3 years, I took part in City Hospital projects
in Ankara Head Office. Due to organizational change, I worked as Design Office Architect at Basaksehir City
Hospital construction site last 3 years. Since January 2021, I have personally provided architectural project
support to my contacts and focused on my personal development. As of April 2021, I have been serving as a
Architectural Project Executive for the architectural office, which is a solution partner in projects carried out with
the BIM method, with a remote working system.</p>
    <p>In my work and training life, I received very positive feedback from my instructors and superiors about my
communication skills and sense of responsibility and my ability to work in a team. Besides, I can define myself
as tolerant, enthusiastic for learning, consistent, rigorous, versatile, and I pay attention to keep these aspects
strong. By combining these personal characteristics with my technical skills and knowledge, I aim to continue my
business life by adding value to my work and myself.</p>
    <p>You can see details about my CV below. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
